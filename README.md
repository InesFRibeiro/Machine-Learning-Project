# Machine-Learning-Customer-Prediction-Project

This project was developed for the course of Machine Learning.

This project is about the development of a model that predicts if a customer is going to buy the products 
of the company or not. The company is called TechScape, and their core business revolves around 
selling products that helps customers do a digital detox. 
Our goal is to answer the question: “Which customers are more likely to buy our products?”. 
We started by doing data pre-processing, feature selection, creating dummy variables (one hot 
encoding), balancing the dataset, scaling, feature engineering and testing different models, with 
different datasets and hyperparameters. 
After we found the best performing model, and the best hyperparameters, this corresponded to an f1 
score of 0.73096 on Kaggle (0.68 in the validation dataset). 
We could only use models from Scikit-learn.
